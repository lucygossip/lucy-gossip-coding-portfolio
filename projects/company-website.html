                        <p>I contributed to this project as part of a training course with Kreativstorm.</p>
                        <p>My group was tasked with creating a website according to a client's specifications, using HTML and CSS only.</p>
                        <p>The most challenging part of this assignment was ensuring that every page had a consistent appearance, even though several different developers were working on it. To help with this, I created and styled header and footer elements to be used on all project pages. These elements were created using responsive design principles. I also assisted other members in implementing the header and footer into their pages.</p>
                        <p>One of the problems we ran into was that different developers had different interpretations of the client's vision. At first, some of the pages did not match up very well. However, through discussion and continuing to reference the client's specifications, we were able to adjust the pages until the style was more coherent. As a result, our project transformed from a collection of pages, to a single entity.</p>
                        <p>Through creating this project, I learned more about the importance of teamwork and communication. I also learned about the importance of realizing a client's vision as closely as possible to what they have asked for.</p>
