                        <p>"The Peak's View" is a responsive article design, created for use on a website called World of Legends. This design is in keeping with the medieval fantasy theme of the website.</p>
                        <p>The design uses only HTML and CSS, and is easy to use regardless of your level of coding knowledge.</p>
                        <p>I chose to do this project because a new editor was brought in to write articles for the site. This person was a good writer, but did not know how to use code, and wanted a template to use to write the articles.</p>
                        <p>The version presented here is the second version of the code, which was redesigned to be more responsive than my first attempt. It adjusts easily to different sized screens, and is much cleaner.</p>
                        <p>Through creating this template, I practiced responsive design and use of the flex box. I also learned about colour choices and how to create a design in keeping with the site's medieval theme.</p>
