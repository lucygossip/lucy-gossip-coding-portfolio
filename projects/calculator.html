                        <p>I contributed to this project as part of a frontent training course with Kreativstorm.</p>

                        <p>My group was tasked with creating a functionable calculator, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The calculator had to be able to perform basic operations, as well as have keyboard support.</p>
                        <p>Our process was to divide the work among the team members. One member wrote the HTML, two worked on CSS and two worked on the JavaScript. Although our roles were separate, we had to make sure that we communicated to get all the parts to work together.</p>
                        <p>I created responsive styles that changed according to the user's preferences. These included options for light and dark mode, contrast and reduced motion. My styling choices were informed by web accessibility research, which influenced me to check to make sure the colours had good contrast.</p>
                        <p>The group had different approaches to the JavaScript, and several versions of the script were created. We ultimately decided to keep it simple and used the one that was easiest to read and understand by everyone.</p>
                        <p>I also tested the calculator and used my findings to provide feedback to the rest of the group. With a keen eye for detail, I was able to identify a bug where the operation chaining did not work as intended. As a result, the group was able to replicate and eventually fix it.</p>
