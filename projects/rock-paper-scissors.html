                        <p>This project was an assignment for a Kreativestorm frontend training course. We were put into a group of 5 and worked collaboratively to create a game of rock, paper, scissors.</p>

                        <p>For this project, I took the role of team leader, and took charge of organising which members would be in charge of which aspects of the game. I was also responsible for the creation of the computerPlay function, which randomly generates the computer's choice of rock, paper or scissors.</p>

                        <p>As a team, we ensured that user inputs were accounted for, and that all different outcomes of the game were taken into consideration. Furthermore, we provided flavour text to keep the game interesting and fun.</p>
                        <p>The most difficult part of the project was making sure that all variables were accounted for. Through continuously testing the game, we made adjustments to account for a variety of invalid player inputs; as a result, we were able to make our code more robust and less easy to break.</p>
